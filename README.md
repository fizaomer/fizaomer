### About Me

I'm a recent UC San Diego graduate in Cognitive Science: Machine Learning and Neural Computation!

I specialize in AI that turns complex data into clear, actionable outcomes.

Whether itâ€™s ranking algorithms that improve search relevance, machine learning models that detect medical conditions, or automated pipelines that save hours of manual work, I build solutions that deliver measurable impact.
